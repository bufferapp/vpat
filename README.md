# Buffer Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT®)
This repository contains Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT®) documents for Buffer.

## Making Changes
As we make improvements with accessibility, let's update our VPAT so it reflects the most up-to-date assessment. 

1. Clone the vpat repo if needed: `git clone git@github.com:bufferapp/vpat.git`
2. Add changes in appropriate vpat document. 
3. Update the date in top of document.
4. Write a descriptive commit so that we understand the history (create a PR if needed).
